### How to Run
Requires `Core` and `Dune` to run.
Our code doesn't have any quirks other than the below, however it lacks error checking, so make sure inputs are correct, or use our example tests. 

NOTE: expressions do not modify variable values. Instead of `i++` use `i = i++` to update the value.

Use `dune runtest` to execute the tests, which should not return any errors. The tests cover:

- basic expressions
- variable assignment
- single value operators
- two value operators
- reassigning variables
- if statements
- while loops
- for loops
- recursive functions
- multi variable functions
- breaks and continues
