Our code should work as expected. NOTE: expressions do not modify variable values. Instead of `i++` use `i = i++` to update the value.

Use `dune runtest` to execute the tests, which should not return any errors. The tests cover:

- basic expressions
- variable assignment
- single value operators
- two value operators
- reassigning variables
- if statements
- while loops
- for loops
- recursive functions
- multi variable functions
- breaks and continues
